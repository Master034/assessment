Question 2: Code Improvement for Real-World Scenarios
1. Error Handling and User Feedback - API calls can fail due to network issues, invalid endpoints, or server errors, leading to poor user experience if not handled correctly.
2. Performance Optimization - Would implement lazy loading for images
3. State Management - As the application grows, managing state can become cumbersome.
